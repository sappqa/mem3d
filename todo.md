- camera init distance needs to scale with grid size
- zoom ammount needs to scale with grid size
- debug grid drawing issues with different grid_size.
- keyboard controls/animation controls - start stop, reset scrub. needs to interface nicely with the live render list...
- better file/folder structure and graphics logic encapsulation
- add command line args for ex_linked_list num allocs

maybe later:
- add input args checking/parsing
- add 3d axis
    - adjust camera constraints accordingly
- encapsulate graphics debugging logic
- display/hide keyboard controls cheatsheet
- add segment tree optimization plugin
